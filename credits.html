        <h1>about this website.</h1>
        <p>
            We simply want people to be aware of what's going on in their life. We need everyone to stand together to
            make a better world.
        </p>
        <p>
            Unfortunately, there are more reasons as to why we are ruining our planet, but
            for now we wanted to highlight the most important reasons.
