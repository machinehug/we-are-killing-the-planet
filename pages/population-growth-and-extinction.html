                <b>H</b>uman overpopulation (or population overshoot) is when there are too many people for the
                environment
                to sustain (with food, drinkable water, breathable air, etc.). In more scientific terms, there is
                overshoot
                when the ecological footprint of a human population in a geographical area exceeds that place's carrying
                capacity, damaging the environment faster than nature can repair it, potentially leading to an
                ecological
                and societal collapse. Overpopulation could apply to the population of a specific region, or to world
                population as a whole.
            </p>
            <p class="article-larger-text">Advocates of population moderation cite issues like exceeding the Earth's
                carrying capacity, global warming, potential or imminent ecological collapse, impact on quality of
                life,
                and risk of mass starvation or even extinction as a basis to argue for population decline.
                Scientists
                suggest that the overall human impact on the environment, due to overpopulation, overconsumption,
                pollution, and proliferation of technology, has pushed the planet into a new geological epoch known
                as
                the Anthropocene.

            <h2>Pollution</h2>
            <p>
                Population growth increases levels of air pollution, water pollution, soil contamination and noise
                pollution. Air pollution is causing changes in atmospheric composition and consequent global warming
                and
                ocean acidification.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h2>Potential ecological collapse</h2>
            <p>
                Ecological collapse refers to a situation where an ecosystem suffers a drastic, possibly permanent,
                reduction in carrying capacity for all organisms, often resulting in mass extinction. Usually, an
                ecological collapse is precipitated by a disastrous event occurring on a short time scale.
                Ecological
                collapse can be considered as a consequence of ecosystem collapse on the biotic elements that
                depended
                on the original ecosystem. The ocean is in great danger of collapse. In a study of 154 different
                marine
                fish species, David Byler came to the conclusion that many factors such as overfishing, climate
                change,
                and fast growth of fish populations will cause ecosystem collapse. When humans fish, they usually
                will
                fish the populations of the higher trophic levels such as salmon and tuna. The depletion of these
                trophic levels allow the lower trophic level to overpopulate, or populate very rapidly. For example,
                when the population of catfish is depleting due to overfishing, plankton will then overpopulate
                because
                their natural predator is being killed off. This causes an issue called eutrophication. Since the
                population all consumes oxygen the dissolved oxygen (DO) levels will plummet. The DO levels dropping
                will cause all the species in that area to have to leave, or they will suffocate. This along with
                climate change, and ocean acidification can cause the collapse of an ecosystem.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h2>Depletion and destruction of resources</h2>
            <p>
                Further environmental impacts that overpopulation may cause include depletion of natural resources,
                especially fossil fuels. Overpopulation does not depend only on the size or density of the
                population,
                but on the ratio of population to available sustainable resources. It also depends on how resources
                are
                managed and distributed throughout the population. The resources to be considered when evaluating
                whether an ecological niche is overpopulated include clean water, clean air, food, shelter, warmth,
                and
                other resources necessary to sustain life. If the quality of human life is addressed, there may be
                additional resources considered, such as medical care, education, proper sewage treatment, waste
                disposal and energy supplies. Overpopulation places competitive stress on the basic life sustaining
                resources, leading to a diminished quality of life.
