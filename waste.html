        <h1>WASTE</h1>
    </section>

    <article>
        <p>
            <b>Plastic pollution</b> is the accumulation of plastic objects and particles (e.g.: plastic bottles and
            much more) in the Earth's environment that adversely affects wildlife, wildlife habitat, and humans.
            Plastics that act as pollutants are categorized into micro-, meso-, or macro debris, based on size. Plastics
            are inexpensive and durable, and as a result levels of plastic production by humans are high. However, the
            chemical structure of most plastics renders them resistant to many natural processes of degradation and as a
            result they are slow to degrade. Together, these two factors have led to a high prominence of
            plastic pollution in the environment. Plastic pollution can afflict land, waterways and oceans. It is
            estimated that 1.1 to 8.8 million metric tons (MT) of plastic waste enters the ocean from coastal
            communities each year. Living organisms, particularly marine animals, can be harmed either by mechanical
            effects, such as entanglement in plastic objects, problems related to ingestion of plastic waste, or through
            exposure to chemicals within plastics that interfere with their physiology. Effects on humans include
            disruption of various hormonal mechanisms.
        </p>
        <p class="article-larger-text">
            As of 2018, about 380 million tons of plastic is produced worldwide each year.
            From the 1950s up to 2018, an estimated 6.3 billion tons of plastic has been produced worldwide, of
            which an estimated 9% has been recycled and another 12% has been incinerated. This large amount of
            plastic waste enters the environment, with studies suggesting that the bodies of 90% of seabirds contain
            plastic debris. In some areas there have been significant efforts to reduce the prominence of free range
            plastic pollution, through reducing plastic consumption, litter cleanup, and promoting plastic
            recycling. Some researchers suggest that by 2050 there could be more plastic than fish in the oceans by
            weight.
        </p>
        <h2>Effects on the environment</h2>
        <p>
            The distribution of plastic debris is highly variable as a result of certain factors such as wind and
            ocean currents, coastline geography, urban areas, and trade routes. Human population in certain areas
            also plays a large role in this. Plastics are more likely to be found in enclosed regions such as the
            Caribbean. It serves as a means of distribution of organisms to remote coasts that are not their native
            environments. This could potentially increase the variability and dispersal of organisms in specific
            areas that are less biologically diverse. Plastics can also be used as vectors for chemical contaminants
            such as persistent organic pollutants and heavy metals.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h2>Plastic pollution as a cause of climate change</h2>
        <p>
            In 2019 a new report "Plastic and Climate" was published. According to the report, in 2019, plastic will
            contribute greenhouse gases in the equivalent of 850 million tons of carbon dioxide (CO2) to the
            atmosphere. In current trend, annual emissions will grow to 1.34 billion tons by 2030. By 2050 plastic
            could emit 56 billion tons of Greenhouse gas emissions, as much as 14 percent of the earth’s remaining
            carbon budget. By 2100 it will emit 260 billion tons, more than half of the carbon budget. Those are
            emission from production, transportation, incineration, but there are also effects on Phytoplankton.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h2>Effects of plastic on land</h2>
        <p>
            Plastic pollution on land poses a threat to the plants and animals - including humans who are based on
            the land. Estimates of the amount of plastic concentration on land are between four and twenty three
            times that of the ocean. The amount of plastic poised on the land is greater and more concentrated than
            that in the water. Mismanaged plastic waste ranges from 60 percent in East Asia and Pacific to one
            percent in North America. The percentage of mismanaged plastic waste reaching the ocean annually and
            thus becoming plastic marine debris is between one third and one half the total mismanaged waste for
            that year. Chlorinated plastic can release harmful chemicals into the surrounding soil, which can then
            seep into groundwater or other surrounding water sources and also the ecosystem of the world. This can
            cause serious harm to the species that drink the water.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h2>Effects on animals</h2>
        <p class="article-larger-text">
            Plastic pollution has the potential to poison animals, which can then adversely affect human food
            supplies. Plastic pollution has been described as being highly detrimental to large marine mammals,
            described in the book Introduction to Marine Biology as posing the "single greatest threat" to them.
            Some marine species, such as sea turtles, have been found to contain large proportions of plastics in
            their stomach. When this occurs, the animal typically starves, because the plastic blocks the animal's
            digestive tract. Sometimes Marine mammals are entangled in plastic products such as nets, which can harm
            or kill them.
        </p>
        <br />
        <br />
        <h2>Environmental dumping</h2>
        <p>
            The shipment of waste between countries has been referred to as “transfrontier shipment” of waste.
            Transfrontier waste is shipped within the European Union (EU) and between the European Union and other
            countries. Most of this waste is traded by Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)
            countries. The waste is typically non-hazardous and includes metals, plastics, and paper products. In
            2007, it is estimated that OECD countries exported between 4 and 5 million tons of metal and paper
            waste. OECD countries also exported near a half of million tons of recovered plastics in 2007. Some of
            these wastes that are transported can be hazardous waste. These hazardous wastes can cause potential
            health risks to humans and the environment. According to the Basel Convention, there is at least 8
            million tons of hazardous waste imported and exported every year.The Basel Convention was created in
            1989 but started enforcing rules in 1992. The purpose of the Convention is to control the hazardous
            waste that was imported and exported throughout the EU. The Convention is a great contributor to
            stopping the shipment of illegal waste. In May 2005, 60 containers were seized that were on their way
            from the United Kingdom to China. The containers seized by Dutch authorities were supposed to be for
            paper but actually contained household wastes. Since neither the UK, China, nor Dutch had agreed to the
            importation of the wastes, the waste was shipped back. The Basel Convention also deals with the popular
            growing issue of E-waste. The Waste Shipment Regulation confirms what can be shipped to, from, and
            between EU countries.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
            Environmental dumpingis the practice of transfrontier shipment of waste (household
            waste, industrial/nuclear waste, etc.) from one country to another. The goal is to take the waste to a
            country that has less strict environmental laws, or environmental laws that are not strictly enforced.
            The economic benefit of this practice is cheap disposal or recycling of waste without the economic
            regulations of the original country. An example of an attempt at environmental dumping is the story of
            the decommissioned French aircraft carrier, the FS Clemenceau, which was originally sold to a
            ship-breaking yard in Gujarat India to be demolished and recycled as scrap. The Indian Supreme
            Court ruled in 2006 that it could not enter Indian waters due to the high level of toxic waste and 700
            tons of asbestos present on the ship, forcing the French government to take the Clemenceau back. The
            ship was subsequently blocked from entering the Suez Canal for the same reason. In 2009, the task of
            recycling the vessel was ultimately taken over by specialist recyclers at Hartlepool in the United
            Kingdom.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h2>Ocean dumping</h2>
        <p class="article-larger-text">
            Shipment of waste from country to country can also involve dumping waste into the ocean. Ocean dumping
            has been a problem since the 19th century. It was legal to dump industrial waste into the ocean until
            the Ocean Dumping Act was passed in 1972. During the years of 1970 and 1980 alone, it was estimated that
            25 million tons of waste including scrap metal, chemicals, and acids were dumped into the ocean. Ocean
            dumping can lead to eutrophication which depletes the oxygen from the water, in turn killing marine
            life.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h2>Ship dismantling</h2>
        <p>
            Ship dismantling is another form of trans frontier waste that is shipped from country to country. Many
            ships are broken down into parts that can be recycled. Many parts of the ships are hazardous and can
            potentially pollute the areas that they are broken down in. The ship parts can contain asbestos, PCB's,
            and oil sludge. All of these components can be a potential health risk and harm the environment. Most
            ship scrapping industries are in developing countries where the laws (environmentally as well as
            occupationally) are not as strict as in developed countries. International Maritime Organization states
            that India is the leader in ship dismantling, followed by China, Bangladesh, and Pakistan.

            The aircraft carrier Clemenceau was denied access to Indian waters because it contained asbestos. The
            French aircraft was carried from France to Britain to be recycled on February 8, 2009 despite the
            abundance of asbestos. The EU Commission proposed improvements to be made to improve the ship
            dismantling as well as the ocean dumping process on November 19, 2008. Public consultations were held in
            2009, and stakeholder workshops were organized between 2009 and 2011. On March 26, 2009, the EU
            Parliament adopted a resolution on the Communication that was adopted by the Commission on October 21,
            2009.

            The European Council’s Conclusions endorse the Hong Kong Convention on environmentally responsible ship
            recycling, adopted in May 2009. According to the International Maritime Organization, he Hong Kong
            Convention “intends to address all the issues around ship recycling, including the fact that ships sold
            for scrapping may contain environmentally hazardous substances such as asbestos, heavy metals,
            hydrocarbons, ozone-depleting substances and others. It also addresses concerns raised about the working
            and environmental conditions at many of the world's ship recycling locations.” recycling is very
            important when it comes to recycling devices.
