            <b>T</b>he environmental impact of meat production varies because of the wide variety
            of agricultural practices employed around the world. All agricultural practices have been found to have a
            variety of effects on the environment. Some of the environmental effects that have been associated with meat
            production are pollution through fossil fuel usage, animal methane, effluent waste, and water and land
            consumption. Meat is obtained through a variety of methods, including organic farming, free range
            farming, intensive livestock production, subsistence agriculture, hunting, and fishing.

            <p style="font-size: 18px;">Meat is considered one of the prime factors contributing to the current sixth
                mass extinction. The 2019 IPBES Global Assessment Report on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services found
                that industrial agriculture and overfishing are the primary drivers of the extinction crisis, with the
                meat and dairy industries having a substantial impact. The 2006 report Livestock's Long Shadow, released
                by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations, states that "the livestock sector
                is a major stressor on many ecosystems and on the planet as a whole. Globally it is one of the largest
                sources of greenhouse gases (GHG) and one of the leading causal factors in the loss of biodiversity,
                while in developed and emerging countries it is perhaps the leading source of water pollution." (In this
                and much other FAO usage, but not always elsewhere, poultry are included as "livestock".) A 2017 study
                published in the journal Carbon Balance and Management found animal agriculture's global methane
                emissions are 11% higher than previous estimates based on data from the Intergovernmental Panel on
                Climate Change. Some fraction of these effects is assignable to non-meat components of the livestock
                sector such as the wool, egg and dairy industries, and to the livestock used for tillage. Livestock have
                been estimated to provide power for tillage of as much as half of the world's cropland. A July 2018
                study in Science asserts that meat consumption will increase as the result of human population
                growth and rising individual incomes, which will increase carbon emissions and further reduce
                biodiversity.</p>

            <p>On August 8, 2019, the IPCC released a summary of the 2019 special report which asserted that a shift
                towards plant-based diets would help to mitigate and adapt to climate change. According to a 2018 study
                in the journal Nature, a significant reduction in meat consumption will be "essential" to mitigate
                climate change, especially as the human population increases by a projected 2.3 billion by the middle of
                the century. In November 2017, 15,364 world scientists signed a Warning to Humanity calling for, among
                other things, drastically diminishing our per capita consumption of meat. A similar shift to meat-free
                diets appears also as the only safe option to feed a growing population without further deforestation,
                and for different yields scenarios.</p>

            <br />

            <h3>Consumption and production trends</h3>

            <p>Changes in demand for meat may change the environmental impact of meat production by influencing how much
                meat is produced. It has been estimated that global meat consumption may double from 2000 to 2050,
                mostly as a consequence of increasing world population, but also partly because of increased per capita
                meat consumption (with much of the per capita consumption increase occurring in the developing world).
                Global production and consumption of poultry meat have recently been growing at more than 5 percent
                annually. Trends vary among livestock sectors. For example, global per capita consumption of pork has
                increased recently (almost entirely due to changes in consumption within China), while global per capita
                consumption of ruminant meats has been declining.</p>

            <br />

            <h3>Effects on antibiotic resistance</h3>
            <p>Approximately 90% of the total use of antimicrobials in the United States was for non-therapeutic
                purposes in agricultural production. Livestock production has been associated with increased antibiotic
                resistance in bacteria, and has been associated with the emergence of microbes which are resistant to
                multiple antimicrobials (often referred to as superbugs).</p>
