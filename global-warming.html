            <p>
                <b>G</b>lobal warming is the long-term rise in the average temperature of the Earth's climate system. It
                is
                a major aspect of current climate change, and has been demonstrated by direct temperature
                measurements and
                by measurements of various effects of the warming. The term commonly refers to the mainly human-caused
                increase in global surface temperatures and its projected continuation. In this context, the
                terms global
                warming and climate change are often used interchangeably, but climate change includes both global
                warming and its effects, such as changes in precipitation and impacts that differ by region. There were
                prehistoric periods of global warming, but observed changes since the mid-20th century have been much
                greater than those seen in previous records covering decades to thousands of years.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment
                Report concluded, "It is extremely likely that human influence has been the dominant cause of the
                observed warming since the mid-20th century." The largest human influence has been the emission
                of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide. Climate model projections
                summarized in the report indicated that during the 21st century the global surface temperature is likely
                to rise a further 0.3 to 1.7 °C (0.5 to 3.1 °F) in a moderate scenario, or as much as 2.6 to 4.8 °C (4.7
                to 8.6 °F) in an extreme scenario, depending on the rate of future greenhouse gas emissions and
                on climate feedback effects. These findings have been recognized by the national science academies of
                the major industrialized nations and are not disputed by any scientific body of national or
                international standing.
            </p>
            <p>
                The effects of global warming include rising sea levels, regional changes in precipitation, more
                frequent extreme weather events such as heat waves, and expansion of deserts. Surface temperature
                increases are greatest in the Arctic, which has contributed to the retreat of glaciers, permafrost,
                and sea ice. Overall, higher temperatures bring more rain and snowfall, but for some
                regions droughts and wildfires increase instead. Climate change threatens to diminish crop yields,
                harming food security, and rising sea levels may flood coastal infrastructure and force
                the abandonment of many coastal cities. Environmental impacts include the extinction or relocation of
                many species as their ecosystems change, most immediately the environments of coral reefs, mountains,
                and the Arctic. Because the climate system has a large "inertia" and greenhouse gases persist in the
                atmosphere, climatic changes and their effects will continue for many centuries even if greenhouse gas
                emissions are stopped.
            </p>
            <p>Possible societal responses to global warming include mitigation by emissions reduction, adaptation to
                its effects, and maybe climate engineering. Countries work together on climate change under the umbrella
                of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), which has near-universal
                membership. The ultimate goal of the convention is to "prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with
                the climate system". Although the parties to the UNFCCC have agreed that deep cuts in emissions are
                required and that global warming should be limited to well below 2 °C (3.6 °F) in the Paris
                Agreement,[23] the Earth's average surface temperature has already increased by about half this
                threshold and current pledges by countries to cut emissions are inadequate to limit future warming. Some
                scientists question the feasibility, in higher emissions scenarios, of climate adaptation.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h2>Observed temperature changes</h2>
            <p>
                Over 2,000 years of average temperatures over the earth's surface have been constructed,
                both indirectly through deductive scientific methods (dark blue line), and directly by measuring
                instruments (black line, since 1858).
            </p>
            <p>
                Climate proxy records show that natural variations offset the early effects of the Industrial
                Revolution,
                so there was little net warming between the 18th century and the mid-19th century, when thermometer
                records began to provide global coverage. The IPCC has adopted the baseline reference period 1850–1900
                as an approximation of pre-industrial global mean surface temperature.
            </p>
            <p>
                Multiple independently produced instrumental datasets confirm that the 2009–2018 decade was 0.93 ±
                0.07 °C warmer than the pre-industrial baseline (1850–1900). Currently, surface temperatures are rising
                by about 0.2 °C per decade. Since 1950, the number of cold days and nights have decreased, and the
                number of warm days and night have increased. Historical patterns of warming and cooling, like
                the Medieval Climate Anomaly and the Little Ice Age, were not as synchronous as current warming, but may
                have reached temperatures as high as those of the late-20th century in a limited set of regions.
            </p>
            <p>
                Although the most common measure of global warming is the increase in the near-surface atmospheric
                temperature, over 90% of the additional energy stored in the climate system over the last 50 years has
                warmed ocean water. The remainder of the additional energy has melted ice and warmed the continents and
                the atmosphere.
            </p>
            <p>
                The warming evident in the instrumental temperature record is consistent with a wide range of
                observations, documented by many independent scientific groups; for example, in most continental regions
                the frequency and intensity of heavy precipitation has increased. Further examples include sea level
                rise, widespread melting of snow and land ice, increased heat content of the oceans, increased humidity,
                and the earlier timing of spring events, such as the flowering of plants.
